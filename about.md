I am a Senior QC Scientist at Addgene. In my current role, my primary responsiblity is ensuring the timely and accurate quality assesment of materials in Addgene's repository. I am also the primary QC contact for the Pooled Library service, am responsible for leading new sequencing projects, and regularly contribute to Blog/Website content. 

Previously, I earned my Ph.D. in the Stevenson Laboratory at the University of Kentucky. The general focus of the lab is the study gene regulatory mechanisms in pathogenic spirochetes. My graduate work specifically dealt with gene regulatory mechanisms and gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in the causative agent of Lyme disease, *Borrelia burgdorferi*. My dissertation work contributed to the understanding of physiologic nutrient status as a mechanism of regulating virulence in *Borrelia burgdorferi*.

### More Information

I am more generally interested in high-throughput approaches and the application of computational approaches to larger and larger biological data sets.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy spending time outdoors and traveling with my with my partner and our pets.
