I am currently a Doctoral candidate in the Stevenson Laboratory at the University of Kentucky. The general focus of the lab is the study gene regulatory mechanisms in pathogenic spirochetes. My graduate work specifically deals with gene regulatory mechanisms and gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in the causative agent of Lyme disease, *Borrelia burgdorferi*.

### More Information

I am more generally interested in high-throughput approaches and the application of computational approaches to larger and larger biological data sets.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy spending time outdoors and traveling with my with my partner and our pets.
